        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two passionate
            developers who turned
            their love for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding by day and cooking by night,
            they decided to merge their
            two passions and create something extraordinary.

            Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends who met at a hackathon and discovered a shared
            love for innovative cuisine.
            With a background in software development and a knack for culinary creativity, they embarked on a
            journey to deliver delicious,
            tech-themed dishes to the community.
